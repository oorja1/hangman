FOCUSED AREA - GAME DEVELOPMENT

MOTIVATION
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game that not only entertains but also challenges players' vocabulary and deduction skills. Its simplicity and educational value make it a popular choice for leisure and learning alike.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project was to develop an interactive Hangman game using Python, showcasing proficiency in programming logic, user interface design, and game development fundamentals. The game aims to engage users, test their word knowledge, and provide an enjoyable gaming experience.

APPROACH

1. Game Logic and Design:

Implemented the core game logic including word selection, player input validation, and tracking of guessed letters.
Designed a user-friendly interface with ASCII art for the hangman stages, enhancing the game's visual appeal and immersion.
2. User Interaction and Feedback:

Enabled user input for letter guesses and provided feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
Incorporated scoring and win/loss conditions to create a challenging yet rewarding gameplay experience.
3. Code Structure and Documentation:

Organized the codebase into modular functions for improved readability and maintainability.
Documented key functionalities and game rules within the code for ease of understanding and future enhancements.
4. Testing and Refinement:

Conducted thorough testing to ensure game functionality across different scenarios and user inputs.
Iteratively refined the game mechanics based on user feedback and testing results, optimizing for player engagement and enjoyment.
